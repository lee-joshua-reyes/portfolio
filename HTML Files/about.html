      <h2>Ball. Code. Repeat.</h2>
      <p>
        Hey, I'm <strong>Lee Joshua Reyes</strong>, a good IT student at St. Dominic College of Asia.
        I’m someone who manages both <strong>basketball and schoolwork.</strong>
        Despite the challenges, I’ve been able to <strong>train and study consistently.</strong>
        Time has been the <strong>most difficult</strong> part to manage.
        Even though I <strong>sometimes feel exhausted</strong>, my dreams <strong>keep me going</strong> whenever I feel like giving up.
        <br><br>
        I <strong>didn't plan</strong> to be an IT student. It <strong>just happened</strong> due to a bit of circumstance.
        Initially, I felt <strong>uncomfortable and questioned</strong> where I belonged in this field.
        However, over time, I grew to <strong>appreciate understanding how things work</strong>,
        such as system operations, troubleshooting, and coding.
        Something that <strong>began unexpectedly</strong> turned into something I now <strong>value deeply</strong>.
        I'm <strong>content with where I ended up</strong>. I've <strong>developed a genuine interest in IT</strong> and want to learn more,
        especially about artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software development.
        Even though <strong>it wasn't my original plan</strong>, I now look forward to what the <strong>future holds</strong>.
      </p>
